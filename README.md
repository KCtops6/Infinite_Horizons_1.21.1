# Infinite Horizons 2
## Overview
[Infinite Horizons 2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/infinite-horizons-2-superflat-survival) is a remastered and refined 1.21.1 version of my original [Infinite Horizons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/modded-super-flat-survival) modpack for 1.20.1. This pseudo-skyblock kitchen sink modpack is designed for the player to gather resources starting from a standard superflat world with villages. The nether and end dimensions are unlocked once you have made significant progression in the game. Most resources, even ones that you would usually only find in the nether and end, can be obtained in the overworld through various means.

## Optional Compacts or Addon Mods
To make sure the modpack is not too bloated and has mods you will never use, only the basic mods for the modpack are included. It does not matter if you are interested in tech mods, magic mods, or a mix of both. The following table lists the additional mods you can add and their recommended versions. Documentation about exactly how these are integrated is on the [wiki](https://github.com/KCtops6/Infinite_Horizons_1.21.1/wiki). Is there a mod that you would like to be integrated into Infinite Horizons 2? Leave a suggestion!
